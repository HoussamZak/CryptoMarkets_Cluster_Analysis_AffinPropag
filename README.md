# CryptoMarkets_Cluster_Analysis_AffinPropag
The goal is to interpret the cryptomarket with the help of the 2D map & overlay network obtainded with affinity propagation a better clustering technique.

Clustering is an unsupervised learning tefchnique that aims to group similar objects into clusters while separating from different 
objects.Crypto being filled with real word data, prototype based clustering approaches are not the best approach given that the number of clusters is unknown and difficult to guess which is why we rely on affinity propagation an approach that automatically estimate the number of clusters. 

Affinity propagation identifies clusters by comparing data point with one another by measuring similarities, this approach selects cluster centers that represent other surrounding data points.

Modules needed:
    -Pandas
    -NumPy
    -Cmcscraper
    -Matplotlib
    -Seaborn
